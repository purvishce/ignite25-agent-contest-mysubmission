## Your Mission

You are the AI strategist at Trey Marketing Inc., a fast-growing start-up preparing for its first major product launch. Moments before the launch, critical issues emerge, threatening to derail months of hard work.

- The countdown is on: 30 minutes to go.
- Investors are watching, customers are waiting, and the pressure is intense.
- Your mission? 

_Leverage your agentic skills and AI expertise to stabilise the situation and ensure a successful launch. Build intelligent agents that can address urgent challenges, fix defects, manage internal communications, and deliver actionable solutions under extreme time constraints_


## Your Team

To complete the mission you will need help from two different sources:
- Models - pick the right AI model for the task
- Tools - connect the right tools to add knowledge or perform actions

### 1. Models

For this contest, we recommend using the GitHub Models marketplace to explore options. It is free (but rate-limited) - and should give you sufficient quota to try your ideas. 

1. You will need a GitHub account. [Create one for free](https://github.com/signup) if needed.
1. You will use the [GitHub Models Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/models) - verify you can access it.
1. Start by [visiting their catalog](https://github.com/marketplace?type=models) - this uses Azure AI Foundry models.


Use the filters to find the right model for your needs:

1. Select by Publisher - the marketplace has all the popular model providers
1. Select by Capabiity - for this context, you want `Chat/Completion`
1. Select by Category - these let you focus on the task types supported
    - All - models support basic question-answering
    - Instruction - models may be tuned to understand specialized domains
    - Multimodal - for supporting image inputs
    - Audio - for support speech 
    - Reasoning - for supporting complex use cases
    - Multilingual - for supporting queries in different languages

**EXAMPLES**

1. Set Published to Azure Open AI
1. Set Capability to Chat/Completion
1. Set Category to:
    - **Reasoning** - example: [o3-mini](https://github.com/marketplace/models/azure-openai/o3-mini)
    - **Multimodal** - example: [gpt-5](https://github.com/marketplace/models/azure-openai/gpt-5)

Once you find a model to try - click **Try In Playground** to see it live and use prompts to validate your ideas.



### 2. Tools

Did you know about the [GitHub MCP Registry](https://github.com/mcp). While we won't be using these tools with the GitHub Models Playground - but we encourage you to explore them and think about what tools might be valuable to add to your model later, if you try to develop the idea with code.
